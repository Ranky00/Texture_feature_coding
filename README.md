# Texture_feature_coding

The provided code serves the purpose of creating texture features specifically from the Regions of Interest (ROI). These texture features encompass a range of statistical measures, such as means, standard deviations, p-values, and t-values. The extraction process targets both first and second-order radiomics features, providing a comprehensive analysis of the underlying data.
After the extraction and computation of these features, the code takes the organized results and compiles them into a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file. This CSV file serves as a structured and easily interpretable data format. The purpose of saving the data in this format is to facilitate subsequent analysis, enabling researchers or practitioners to further investigate and draw insights from the computed texture features. The CSV file can be imported into various data analysis tools, making it convenient for additional statistical examinations or visualization techniques to be applied.
